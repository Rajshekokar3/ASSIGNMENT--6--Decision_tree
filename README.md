# ASSIGNMENT--6--Decision_tree
# Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and analyzing a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of importing data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: Overview of the decision tree algorithm.
- **Dataset**: Details about the dataset used (e.g., source, structure, and features).
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Building**: Training a Decision Tree model and tuning its parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
